# Boss Item Drop
This mod adds a chance for Boss tier items to drop from their corresponding boss enemies, with a few extra drops mixed in. Only the host/dedicated server needs to have the mod installed for it to function.

## Installation
Copy the `BossItemDrop.dll` to your BepInEx plugins directory. Or just use a mod manager.

## Feedback
Any and all feedback is appreciated, as this is my first time making a mod for this game.

I've set up a simple Discord server to take feedback for my mods, found at [https://discord.gg/nfhzJad](https://discord.gg/nfhzJad)
